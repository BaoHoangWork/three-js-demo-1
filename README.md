# three-js-demo-1

## NOTE 1
having public folder seems to cause the vercel deploy to be 404
removing the public folder proved to be success

## NOTE 2
local live server & github-pages works fine
however, when deployed -> /batman & /falcon lags 
until batman/ & falcon/ entered -> can load model --> loading INFINITY in console
